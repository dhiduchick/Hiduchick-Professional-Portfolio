# Hiduchick-Professional-Portfolio

## Description

The motivation behind this project was to build out a rough outline for my own personal porfolio. This space will give me a solid platform to showcase my ability to potential employers and customers alike. This process allowed me to see how much room there is to grow within web development, and also about the power of creating a personal brand. This site will provide an oppertunity for potential future employers and colleagues evidence of my drive and excitment to continue to grow as a developer.

## Features

Features of this page include a nav bar with links that send you to their corresponding information within the web page (ie. to sections 'About Me', my 'Work', and a 'Contact-Me' area. Within the work area, there are images with project numbers above them; when the images are clicked, the site will send users directly to those deployed applications. The contact me section works much the same way as the nav bar; when certain elements are clicked (GitHub and email) the user will be taken directly to those URLs.
